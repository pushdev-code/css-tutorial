                    In the fictional universe of Marvel, Wolverine has regenerative powers that can heal any wound, no
                    matter how mortal it is, in addition that same power makes him immune to any disease on Earth and
                    some extraterrestrials. He also possesses superhuman strength, which while not comparable to that of
                    other superheroes like the Hulk, does surpass that of any human.

                    know if a danger looms over you, before it happens. Sometimes this can lead Spider-Man to the source

                    danger

                    Most of the basic characteristics of the comics have varied due to the different interpretations
                    they
                    have given to the character.

                    Having lost his sight, Daredevil's remaining four senses were augmented by radiation to superhuman
                    levels, in the accident he had as a child. Despite his blindness, he can "see" through a "sixth
                    sense"
                    that serves as a bat-like radar.
